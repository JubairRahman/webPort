        <p>
          Here you can meet the ultimate boring and intellectual person who can
          bore you and entertain you. And if you thing you can not beat your
          emotions then please don't do such stupid things. I can help you, and
          assassinate your boredom evilish stuffs as well. Actually I am not
          superstitious, but I am a little stitious. I believe that good things
          will come & good things take time.
